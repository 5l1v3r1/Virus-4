# How it works
This "virus" will run every single program on your computer. At the same time.
The virus will initialise the programms on the computer first (this may take a view minutes) 
and after this process finished it will begin to start the programms.

# Release
You can run the virus.exe located in Realeases.
This is the already compiled Java project and already converted to an .exe file.

# Wrapping
After importing the project you need to **export** the project as a **runnable jar**.
I converted it to an **.exe** using Launch4j. Just choose the jar you exported earlier, 
select the destination for the **.exe**, choose an **icon** and specify the **Min Jre Version** in **JRE** tab.
